 # react-like-button
A medium like react like button using TS & React Hooks, based on **[@Kikobeats/react-clap-button](https://github.com/Kikobeats/react-clap-button)**.  

## Purpose
This repo is for learning use about,  
1. How to manage component package from npm registry, especially about publish, upgrade and release.  
2. How to use storybook for UI component development.
